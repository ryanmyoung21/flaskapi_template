Flask API Template

This repository contains a Flask API template with support for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), token-based authentication, and comprehensive error handling. This template is a solid foundation for building and expanding upon a Flask-based API.

Features

CRUD Operations:

GET /api/resources - Retrieve all resources
GET /api/resources/<int:resource_id> - Retrieve a specific resource by ID
POST /api/resources - Create a new resource
PUT /api/resources/<int:resource_id> - Update an existing resource
DELETE /api/resources/<int:resource_id> - Delete a resource by ID

Authentication: Token-based authentication is used to secure the endpoints.

Error Handling: Handles common HTTP errors such as 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, and 500 Internal Server Error.
